I adapted the source code from https://github.com/hulto/pyDactor to use pyDactor on my computer.
PyDactor is a tool used to redact text on images. The images are first run through the Google
Tesseract OCR and then uses regular expressions to locate specific text that the user wants to 
redact. 

I had to make updates to the source code, for example some compatibility changes to make
it work with Python 3, as well as changes to make it work on my Windows 10 machine.
Installation and setup is explained in the pyDactor-Notebook along with any modifications that
you might have to do. 

Below is an example of a .JPG image of a document before and after redaction
using pyDactor. Enjoy!
